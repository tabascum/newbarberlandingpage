# barberlandingpage

This project came from the need I felt this business to have a website, which could help the barber with his agenda. 
Built on HTML and CSS with Javascript, it allowed me to exercise not only the page structure but also CSS positioning. 
JS has been added to pop-up the navbar in small screens as well as to storage localy the user's data received. 

Further functionalities are yet to be added.
