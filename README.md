# barberlandingpage

This is a landing page for a barber shop.
The project came from the need I felt to have a website to this business, which could help the barber with his agenda. 
Built on HTML and CSS with Javascript, it allowed me to exercise CSS positioning, modal placement and to start using basic Javascript. 
As you may notice the page isn't entirely functional, specially on small screens. I'm still working on this project, but you can already have a idea on the final design and functionality.

I do not own any of the images on the project. They belong to their owner, and the owner of the Barber Shop, Bernardo Massas.
