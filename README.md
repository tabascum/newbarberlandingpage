# barberlandingpage

This project came from the need I felt this business to have a website, which could help the barber with his agenda. 
Built on HTML and CSS with Javascript, it allowed me to exercise not only the HTML page structure but also CSS positioning, modal placement and to start using basic Javascript to have a function allowing the modals to be triggered by pushing a button.

As you may notice the page isn't entirely functional, specially on small screens. 
I'm still working on this project, but you can already have a idea on the final design and functionalities.

I do not own any of the images on the project. They belong to their owners (services background image taken from Pexels), and the owner of the Barber Shop, Bernardo Massas.
